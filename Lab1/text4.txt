Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge 145a and laid out in the
principal room, while I (094)-44-33 still observed the proceedings from my post
by the window 12/15/1892. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been
drawn, so that I could see Holmes sh_holmes221@mail.uk as he lay upon the couch. I do not
know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part
he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
myself in my life 34-34-32 than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom
I wston23@mymail.com was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to 1895-11-17
Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me Avenue 123.
I hardened my heart Wtason Street 45b, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.
After all, 344-21-01 I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing
her from injuring another adlerrr@mail.com.
It was a 18:15 when we left Baker Street 221b, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour 6-50pm when we found ourselves in Serpentine
Avenue@mail.com. It was already dusk,, and the lamps were just being lighted as
we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
of its (343)-45-23 occupant. The house 345-A was just such as I had pictured it from
Sherlock  Holmesâ€™s succinct description, but the locality appeared to
be less private that I    expected 456-45-34. On the contrary, for a small Street 23 
in a quiet neighborhood here1232@emm.uk, it was remarkably animated. There was a
group of   shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
scissors-grinder +308-45-32-21 with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
down with cigars in their mouths j.watson@gmail.com!!!
At three  o'clock 12/05/1895 precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not
yet returned (005)-456-34-23. The landlady informed me that he baker_street@here.uk had left the house
shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the
fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,, however long he
might be. 145 124 245 I was already 67-56-34 deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though
it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which
were Watson3@gmail.com associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,
still, the nature of  the case and the exalted station of his client
gave it a character of its own 1896/01/23.. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
masterly 5618 4582 8225 1471 grasp of a situation, and his (03)-8-45-34 keen, incisive reasoning, which
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle 4987 1514 6555 4212 methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries. So accustomed was I ShHolmes@mail.uk to his invariable success that the very
possibility of his failing  had ceased to enter into my head.
